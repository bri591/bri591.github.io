# Favorite Labs in 120L Labs

* Lab 5, Part 1

    This is another one of my favorite labs since I was able to understand the use of functions 
    and how organized the program becomes. I think there are plenty of practical uses for 
    functions when it comes to putting your data neatly, storing information, or 
    just putting the program into a format thatâ€™s easier to read. Also, it made me realize how 
    calculators work and how they are programmed to calculate bigger numbers.

* Lab 7

    This was one of my favorite labs to do because of how technical it was. We were ordered to 
    create a program that showed the parking rules for four streets. Each had different 
    specific times that were supposed to show the user when they were able to park. I liked how 
    I was able to expand my knowledge on writing variables (from strings to doubles) and 
    inputting the correct operators that represented the times well.

* Lab 8, Part 1

    This lab helped me apply the use of vectors and arguments into a program. It was 
    interesting displaying code to tell the user when there weren't enough scores to calculate 
    the average for each judge. Finally, writing loops to find the maximum score and minimum 
    score was very useful for me to know when creating future programs.
